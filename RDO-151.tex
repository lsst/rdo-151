also fall under the LSST Project~Publication Policy.''

Proposed changes in tracked changes:

(1) update Observatory name.
(2) defined new categories of publications, including Project Team papers for, e.g., the upcoming construction performance papers and the as-built system paper.
(3) Re-emphasized that people who joined the project recently (within the past 2 years), and who have contributed meaningfully to enabling the paper, are welcome and encouraged as authors, with examples.
(4) Reminder that both the builders email list and project team email list should be used for general paper notifications.
(5) Suggested more clearly that project team members and builders are notified about papers well before the review phase.
(6) Updated review process and timeline, based on experience since the previous version of this policy.
(7) Statement about transition to Operations.
(8) Update list of publications to cite to include as-built construction papers, and update footnoted URLs.
(9) Considered an option to expand Builders definition to include Science Collaboration Builders (Phil Marshall suggestion).
    This can be taken up in a revision to the document that defines Builders.
(10) Author list compilation process guidelines.
(11) Discussion of escalation path to resolve any publication-related disputes
